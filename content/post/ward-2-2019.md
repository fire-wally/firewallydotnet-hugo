*This is part of a series on the [2019 St. Paul Elections](https://firewally.net/post/st-paul-election-guide-2019)*

Now we move over to Ward 2, home to the St. Paul's best [donuts](http://blog.mojomonkey.biz/), a legendary [Mexican food empire](http://www.elburritostp.com/), and the world's best [roller derby venue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Wilkins_Auditorium). 

# Where is Ward 2?

[Ward 2](https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/city-council#iframe) includes a very interesting and diverse set of neighborhoods: all of Downtown, the West Side, the West 7th neighborhood, and most of Summit Hill. It's the only ward with the Mississippi running through it, and the river also serves as the ward's eastern border. 

## The Candidates

[**Sharon Anderson**](http://sharon4council.blogspot.com/) - a perennial candidate and goofball

[**Lindsay Ferris Martin**](http://lindsayferrismartinforcitycouncilward2.business.site/) - an entrepreneur and marketing professional

[**Bill Hosko**](http://hosko4ward2.org/) - a photographer and gallery owner

[**Helen Meyers**](https://themilitant.com/) - the Socialist Worker's Party candidate

[**Rebecca Noecker**](https://www.rebeccanoecker.com/) - The incumbent councilmember who has served since 2016. 

## Sharon Anderson

Sharon is a local republican who runs for [something or other](https://ballotpedia.org/Sharon_Anderson) every year. Her [campaign website](https://sharon4council.blogspot.com/) is full of half-finished sentences, conspiracy theories, personal vendettas, and support for Donald Trump. She also wants you to vote no on the trash referendum. 

Anyway, don't vote for Sharon Anderson. 

## Lindsay Ferris Martin

Lindsay Ferris Martin works in marketing and social media, and her expertise shows in her online campaign. She has an active presence on all the big social media platforms, her [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lindsayferrismartinward2/) is full of well-composed photography and relevant hashtags, and she presents herself as an engaged, high-energy citizen ready to engage and speak out on the issues that matter to her. 

What issues are those, exactly? Well, the [advocacy statement](https://lindsayferrismartinforcitycouncilward2.business.site/#summary) on her website makes a lot of hay about really *listening*, standing up for the little guy, doing the hard work, and a collection of similar fluff, but there are a few specific issues she calls out as well: "lack of support needed for our first responders", "our right to commerce has been taken away", and a "lack of what to do regarding homelessness and how to preserve the gems that make our neighborhoods unique and special". I'm not sure what she means by "right to commerce", but I'd have to assume that she'd be against recent St. Paul reforms like the minimum wage increase, mandatory sick time, and sustainable to-go packaging. I like all those policies, but there was substantial opposition from the business community, so it's reasonable to assume that someone would try to tap into that opposition to run for council. 

The dystopian horror of politics in 2019 has made me wince when a politician makes a big deal about supporting "first responders", but Lindsay's support seems to come in genuine, positive ways from what I can tell. Her site links to a series of [#graciousmob](https://twitter.com/hashtag/graciousmob) tweets showing Lindsay and her working to deliver tasty food to police officers and firefighters, which is obviously a very nice and thoughtful thing to do for anyone who works long hours at a hard job that serves the public.  Lindsay and I would probably disagree on whether to increase the St. Paul police budget, but I'll refrain from harsher judgment until I see her waving a Punisher flag or some other neo-fascist paraphernalia. 

Lindsay also posted her opposition to [coordinated trash collection](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3NWXCmFvL2/) using a graphic that really captures the condition of St. Paul politics in 2019. Despite her excellent use of bitmoji, ending coordinated collection would be a [really bad idea](https://firewally.net/post/the-trash-post/), and I think you should vote yes and consider other candidates.
