Let's take a look at Ward 4, home of my favorite [concert venue](https://turfclub.net/), everyone's new favorite [soccer team](https://www.mnufc.com/stadium), and my favorite city council rep. 

## Where is Ward 4?

[Ward 4](https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/city-council#iframe) is in the Northwest corner of St. Paul, everything north of St. Clair or Summit and west of Snelling or Lexington as long as you're not in the little Ward 5 hat north of Como Park. All or part of the Union Park, St. Anthony Park, Hamline-Midway, and Como neighborhoods are located in Ward 4, plus a little bit of Macalester-Groveland. 

## The Candidates

There are three candidates running for city council in Ward 4

[**Chris Holbrook**](https://chrisholbrook4w4.nationbuilder.com/) - chair of the Libertarian Party of Minnesota

[**Mitra Jalali Nelson**](http://www.mitranelson.com/) - the incumbent councilmember who won a special election for the seat last year

[**Tarrence Robertson-Bayless**](http://www.tarrence4ward4.com/) - A US Army combat veteran and member of the Minnesota National Guard

## Chris Holbrook

Chris is the chair of the [Libertarian Party of Minnesota](https://www.lpmn.org/) and ran under the Libertarian party banner for Governor in 2014. He also ran for mayor of St. Paul in 2017. His [issues page](https://chrisholbrook4w4.nationbuilder.com/issues) skips over a lot of the Libertarian Party greatest hits (opposing all gun control, opposing all minimum wage laws, advocating cutting all government services) and throws out three policy proposals  for your consideration: "Fix Trash", "Free Parking", "Safe Police".
