Let's take a look at Ward 4, home of my favorite [concert venue](https://turfclub.net/), everyone's new favorite [soccer team](https://www.mnufc.com/stadium), and my favorite city council rep. 

## Where is Ward 4?

[Ward 4](https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/city-council#iframe) is in the Northwest corner of St. Paul, everything north of St. Clair or Summit and west of Snelling or Lexington as long as you're not in the little Ward 5 hat north of Como Park. All or part of the Union Park, St. Anthony Park, Hamline-Midway, and Como neighborhoods are located in Ward 4, plus a little bit of Macalester-Groveland. 

## The Candidates

There are three candidates running for city council in Ward 4

[**Chris Holbrook**](https://chrisholbrook4w4.nationbuilder.com/) - chair of the Libertarian Party of Minnesota

[**Mitra Jalali Nelson**](http://www.mitranelson.com/) - the incumbent councilmember who won a special election for the seat last year

[**Tarrence Robertson-Bayless**](http://www.tarrence4ward4.com/) - A US Army combat veteran and member of the Minnesota National Guard

## Chris Holbrook

Chris is the chair of the [Libertarian Party of Minnesota](https://www.lpmn.org/) and ran under the Libertarian party banner for Governor in 2014. He also ran for mayor of St. Paul in 2017. His [issues page](https://chrisholbrook4w4.nationbuilder.com/issues) skips over a lot of the Libertarian Party greatest hits (opposing all gun control, opposing all minimum wage laws, advocating cutting all government services) and throws out three policy proposals  for your consideration: "Fix Trash", "Free Parking", "Safe Police". 

By "Fix trash", he means vote no on the trash referendum, and [that is a very bad idea](https://firewally.net/post/the-trash-post/)

Under "Safe Police", he wants to increase civilian oversight of the St. Paul Police force, something I'm generally in favor of. Good on him for that. 

Then we get to "Free Parking" - Chris wants to devote more city resources to road maintenance (presumably by abolishing libraries or some other libertarian nonsense) and he wants to designate more free street parking in St. Paul. Now, free parking *should* be an issue on which a liberal urbanist like myself and a libertarian like Chris should agree. Free parking is a harmful government subsidy! It distorts the market and leads to poor allocation of scare resources (in this case, the space on public streets). When the city sets parking minimums on private businesses, it's the exact kind of meddlesome regulation that causes higher prices for consumers that a libertarian should detest. Donald Shoup wrote a whole dang book about [The High Cost of Free Parking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Cost_of_Free_Parking), advocating market-based approaches to pricing parking, and he's become an urbanist legend for it. But Chris Holbrook wants to give away more free parking, because his libertarian principles apparently don't extend to ending a subsidy that disproportionately benefits middle-aged rich white people. 

Anyway, don't vote for Chris Holbrook.
