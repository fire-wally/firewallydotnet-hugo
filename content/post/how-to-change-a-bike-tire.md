# How to change a bike tire

## Installing The New tire

1. Get one side of the tire on to the rim, this should be pretty easy. 
1. If necessary, rotate the tire so that the logo lines up with the valve hole in the rim. Call this the "top" of the wheel and the other end the "bottom". 
1. Put just enough air in the tube so that it takes a toroid shape when laid on the ground.
1. Starting at the top, get the valve through the hole in the rim and then jam the rest of the tube into the tire and onto the rim
1. Starting at the bottom, begin to work the remaining bead onto the rim. Work both sides evenly from the bottom to the top
1. Once you get a few inches from the top, it'll start to be a pain in the ass. Struggle with it for a minute, see if you can get it on there. 
1. At this point, you'll be tempted to force it on with a tire lever. DON'T PICK UP A TIRE LEVER. LEAVE IT. You'll pop that tube every damn time. 
1. Instead, deflate the tube all the way and turn back to the bottom of the wheel
1. At the bottom of the wheel, push the bead of the tire off the sidewall of the rim and crush it down into the center of the rim. This creates slack in the tire. 
1. Work that slack back up to the top and roll the tire back onto the rim. 
1. If it didn't work, go open a beverage, take a 5 minute break, and repeat.
