*This is part of a series on the [2019 St. Paul Elections](https://firewally.net/post/st-paul-election-guide-2019)*

Moving eastward now to Ward 7, home of a [strange wild space](https://www.minnpost.com/stroll/2013/05/exploring-swede-hollow-once-neighborhood-carved-out-wild/) that used to be a strange neighborhood, a [brewery](https://www.stpaulbrewing.com/) that used to be called Flat Earth in a building that used to be Hamm's, and a very cool [regional park](https://www.ramseycounty.us/residents/parks-recreation/parks-trails/find-park/battle-creek-regional-park) (technically the mountain bike trails are in St. Paul but the dog park is in Maplewood). 

## Where is Ward 7?

Ward 7 is in St. Paul's southeast corner, basically everything east of downtown and the Mississippi and south of a stair-step border including 7th st and Minnehaha, Bush, and Stillwater avenues. It's the biggest ward by land area, but a good chunk of that area is taken up by Pig's Eye Lake and Battle Creek Park. 

## The Candidates

## Jane Prince

When reviewing the major votes in the St. Paul City Council over the past few years, a pattern emerges with two types of bills: the bills that passed unanimously, and the bills that Jane Prince voted against. Jane is the voice of a more conservative crowd in St. Paul that does not want more housing density, more bike infrastructure, or more city services, especially if any of the above come at the cost of removing parking spaces or raising property taxes. She voted against the [Ford Site](http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-city-council-expected-to-vote-wednesday-on-divisive-ford-site-plan/448252103/), she voted against [coordinated trash pickup](https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2019/10/is-garbage-enough-to-get-upstart-candidates-elected-to-the-st-paul-city-council/), and she'll vote against [any bike lane](https://www.twincities.com/2017/08/17/half-mile-bike-lane-stillwater-avenue-east-side-st-paul-city-council-vote/) that removes a single parking space. 

Prince's reasoning for voting against these initiatives usually involves a call for further process: the city should gather more feedback, hold more public hearings, do a traffic study, etc. It's easy to call this a delay tactic, and I think it is at least partially that, but I think it also shows a constant grasping for a false compromise between two sides of an issue. For example, Prince just co-authored a [trash editorial](https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/23/prince-busuri-theres-a-better-way-through-this-st-paul-trash-mess/) using a very flowery John Stuart Mill quote to accuse the council and mayor of not "meeting with the trash petitioners and trying to seek contract changes together", exclaiming "These are not the enemies of City Hall!". The implication seems to be that if we all just got together, calmed down the *rhetoric*, really *talked* and *listened* to one another, that some sort of grand consensus would emerge on this contentious issue. Call me a cynic, but I think this approach is painfully naive. In politics, there will be issues where not everyone can get what they want, and a sizable minority of St. Paulites sincerely *do not want* coordinated trash pickup. If we delay every issue until the vocal opposition goes away, we will never accomplish anything in city government because we will be waiting forever. 

So that's why I'm not a Jane Prince fan, but she definitely has supporters in her ward, because she [sailed to the DFL endorsement](https://www.twincities.com/2019/05/25/why-does-the-st-paul-dfl-endorse-candidates-for-nonpartisan-city-races/) on the first ballot this year.
