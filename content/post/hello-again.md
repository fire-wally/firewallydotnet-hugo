description: "I made a website"

I have a website now. Well, I have a website again. I've had a few websites over the years, but this is a new one. The other times that I had a website, they were usually about a single topic.  I can't stay focused on a topic for very long, so some of those websites don't work anymore. Sorry about that, I hate it when websites don't work too. 

Anyway, I have a website. Lately I've been interested in a lot of things - bikes, Mastodon, guitar, video games, new code things I'm learning, urban design, local politics - so I expect this website will be about some or all of those things, eventually. Right now I'm still getting used to having a website again.
