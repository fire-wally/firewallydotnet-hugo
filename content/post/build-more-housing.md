Debates over housing policy usually occur at the smallest possible scale: What are the merits or drawbacks of this proposed apartment building? Should your neighbors be allowed to convert their home into a duplex? How many people could live over the new restaurant going in on the corner? I have participated in a number of these discussions since moving to St. Paul, and although there can be a tiresome repetetiveness to the arguments ("traffic and parking" again and again and again), I do understand the importance of these debates. When designing and building homes that people will live in for a very long time, it's important to get the details right. The way a neighborhood or a city grows and changes is partly determined by what gets built, so it's natural that people want to have a democratic voice in what kind of housing is built near them.

But if we only ever focus on the height of a paricular building or whether it's made of brick or concrete, we might miss the big-picture forces that shape our city and ignore economic trends that are hurting many of our neighbors. So for a moment I'd like to set aside the details and zoom out to tell a story about what has happened in the Minneapolis metro area over the past decade. The same trends have affected many other American cities, and I see no signs that these trends will cease over the next decade, perhaps after temporary slowdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

I would like to make one very simple argument. It's something that many of my friends and neighbors understand intuitively, but it's surprising to me that I don't think I've ever seen it presented simply by our leaders or the media. 

Since 2009, the Minneapolis metropolitan area has not added enough homes for the people who want to move here. The Twin Cities is a desirable place to live for many reasons, chief among them strong job growth over the last decade. That increase in demand for housing without the supply to match it is the overwhelming reason why the cost of housing has increased every year since I've lived here. If we fail to build enough housing to meet demand for it, we should expect rents to continue to rise throughout the metro. 

Discussing changes in housing, population, or jobs are essentially questions about counting things, and of course sometimes the answers depend on how you count. For this article, I'm relying on data published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Year-by-year estimates for [population](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html) and [housing units](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-housing-units.html) at the county level are available at the Census website. For job counts, I used an interactive tool called [OnTheMap](https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/) to access Census estimates of how many people work in particular counties. All of these numbers use the [Seven-County Metro Area](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Twin_Cities_7_Metro_map.png), an informal but widely-used grouping of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and their surrounding suburbs.

I should note here that I'm just a software developer with no formal experience in geography, statistics, or public policy. I did have friends with more specific expertise read drafts of this post, and I welcome corrections or notes on whether I'm using this data appropriately. 

I'm using 2009 as the starting point of my analysis because it marked the end of the Great Recession (at least in terms of GDP) and started a decade of consistent population and job growth in the Twin Cities. The reasons why we've added so many jobs aren't really important to my argument here, but my one-line explainer is that the Twin Cities benefits from a highly educated population, strong roots in growing healthcare and tech industries, and long-term trends towards urbanization across the US. The parks, lakes, and rivers are also quite nice.
