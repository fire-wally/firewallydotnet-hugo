A while back I was cooking dinner from one of those meal delivery services and it seemed like the instructions for how to cook the rice were all wrong. The instructions had me adding a lot less water than I usually use, and cooking the rice a lot longer as well. I ended up splitting the difference between my usual method and what was printed on the recipe card and the rice turned out fine, but it made me wonder: is my mental recipe for cooking white rice weird or unusual? Like many common tasks, I don't remember anyone specifically teaching me how to cook rice, and I've done it so many times with little adjustments here and there that I've probably deviated a fair bit from the original instruction anyway. Maybe I've missed a way of making my rice more consistent or tasty?

So that's how I ended up googling "How to cook rice", and it was a surprisingly enlightening exercise. I was intending to check a few popular recipes to establish some consensus, and figure out whether it was me or the meal delivery service that had the weird recipe. Here's the thing, though. If you take the first page or so of Google results as a representative sample, the consensus answer for "How to cook rice?" is **nobody fucking knows**, apparently. The recipes you find, all for white, medium or long grain rice cooked on a stovetop, are all over the map. For a cup of rice, some suggest two cups of water, some 1 1/2 cups, some just 1 1/4. Pre-rinsing the rice is presented as either as mandatory preparation, an optional step, or never mentioned. Cook time ranges from 10 to 25 minutes, even though the cook temp is always described as "a low simmer". Whether to add any fats or salt also varies widely. 

Because I am an insufferable nerd, I made a little table comparing the top results the internet will give you when you ask it how to cook rice:
