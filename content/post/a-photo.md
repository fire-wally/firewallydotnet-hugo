This is a photo of the Lake/Marshall bridge over the Mississippi between Minneapolis and St. Paul, taken from the next bridge south on 46th street during my bike ride home. I take this picture, or some photo very simlar to it, just about every year. Fall colors, sunset, the mighty Mississippi - what's not to like? I counted once and there are 19 bridges over the Mississippi that have at least one foot in Minneapolis or St. Paul that are passable on bike or on foot. I think I've crossed over most of them by now for one reason or another, but some day it'd be fun to do a long bike ride and cross all of them in a day.
