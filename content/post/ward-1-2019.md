*This is part of a series on the [2019 St. Paul Elections](https://firewally.net/post/st-paul-election-guide-2019)*

It's time now to discuss the City Council race in Ward 1, home of my [favorite soup](https://iphomn.com/), the [bar I got married in](http://sweeneyssaloon.com/), and [everyone's new favorite soccer team](https://www.mnufc.com/stadium). 

## Where is Ward 1?

[Ward 1](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=52051e36d5054be09480a256803c07c8) is St. Paul's middle-est ward, the only ward that doesn't share a border with any neighboring towns. Roughly speaking, it's everything west of 35E, north of Summit, East of Snelling or Lexington, and south of Front ave. All of the Summit-University and Frogtown neighborhoods are in Ward 1, as well as parts of Union Park, Como, and the North End.

## Dai Thao

Dai Thao is a little hard to pin down. There's a lot [about him](http://www.daithao.org/meet_dai) that I like: he was a strong advocate for a minimum wage increase and mandatory sick leave, he fights for more civilian oversight of police, and I think he's done a lot of solid work on Allianz Field and the surrounding area to attract valuable development without throwing gobs of public money at a sports team. 

On housing and transportation issues, Dai says a lot of the [right things](https://streets.mn/2019/10/15/saint-paul-ward-1-candidate-questionnaire-dai-thao/): we need more density, I support the city's bike plan, I want to build more affordable housing, etc. The problem is that, after following St. Paul politics for a few years, I've come to see What Dai Thao Says as a very unreliable predictor of How Dai Thao Votes. On too many issues, he appears to want to have it both ways

As a concrete example, let's review the debate over the Ford Site master plan. If you're just joining us now, the Ford Motor Company manufactured cars for about 100 years in St. Paul until they didn't. As Ford wound down the factory, the city engaged in a decade-long planning effort that culminated in a master plan for a new neighborhood that came before the city council in 2017. Reflecting changes in urban planning and the city's increasing need for housing, the plan called for a more dense, more mixed-use neighborhood than its surroundings at the time, and not without controversy. 

Dai Thao's first major action on the Ford Site was to propose an [amendment](https://finance-commerce.com/2017/09/ford-plan-makes-room-for-low-income-residents/) that made the inclusionary zoning requirements in the plan more strict: the eventual developer would have to set aside more apartments to be rented at below-market rates. Thao argued that "we've got to make sure there is appropriate affordable housing on the site" along with higher-density housing. The council debated this amendment along with many others, and eventually Dai Thao's affordability requirements made it into the final version of the bill. Big victory for Dai Thao, right?

Well, the next thing that Dai Thao did was [vote against](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/09/27/st-paul-council-ordinance-for-mixed-use-development-at-ford-plant-side) the final bill that included his amendment. This puts him in an interesting position, strategically. He can try to ally himself with neighborhood groups that opposed the ford site plan, which he voted against, but he can also claim in the [Streets.mn questionnaire](https://streets.mn/2019/10/15/saint-paul-ward-1-candidate-questionnaire-dai-thao/) that he "was able to push for deep affordable housing goals at the Ford Site". 

This is mostly normal politician stuff, but it gets a shade darker when you review the debate over sustainable to-go packaging over the last few years. Dai Thao was originally in favor of requiring restaurants to use recylcable or compostable to-go boxes, but in 2017 was [accused of soliciting a bribe](http://m.startribune.com/st-paul-leaders-changed-course-on-food-packaging-rules-after-hearing-business-concerns/451348823/) from a lobbyist opposed to the new rules. He then voted to delay the change, but told reporters he was "100% in support". The rules eventually did [pass the council](https://www.twincities.com/2019/03/06/st-paul-city-council-approves-limits-on-restaurants-plastic-takeout-containers/) with Thao's support. 

I don't think that Dai Thao did anything criminal during that process ([No charges](https://www.twincities.com/2017/09/12/scott-county-attorney-declines-charges-in-dai-thao-bribery-solicitation-case/) were ever filed), but I do think asking for a campaign donation from a lobbyist meeting with you about an issue is sloppy and shows poor judgment. And it's more evidence for me that Thao will say what the audience in front of him wants to hear, even if it's not in line with his actions. I don't think Thao's a bad guy and he ends up voting the way I want a lot of the time, but I think we should demand leaders that give us clear reasoning for their actions and that follow up their words with votes when important issues come to the council.
