*This is part of a series on the [2019 St. Paul Elections](https://firewally.net/post/st-paul-election-guide-2019)*

It's time now to discuss the City Council race in Ward 1, home of my [favorite soup](https://iphomn.com/), the [bar I got married in](http://sweeneyssaloon.com/), and [everyone's new favorite soccer team](https://www.mnufc.com/stadium). 

## Where is Ward 1?

[Ward 1](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=52051e36d5054be09480a256803c07c8) is St. Paul's middle-est ward, the only ward that doesn't share a border with any neighboring towns. Roughly speaking, it's everything west of 35E, north of Summit, East of Snelling or Lexington, and south of Front ave. All of the Summit-University and Frogtown neighborhoods are in Ward 1, as well as parts of Union Park, Como, and the North End.
