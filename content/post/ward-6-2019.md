*This is part of a series on the [2019 St. Paul Elections](https://firewally.net/post/st-paul-election-guide-2019)*

Alright, we are finally to the real City Council action in Ward 6, home of some [excellent pancakes](http://www.cookstp.com/), the intersection of two of the [nicest](https://www.ramseycounty.us/sites/default/files/Parks%20and%20Recreation/Regional%20Trail%20Maps%20-%20Bruce%20Vento.pdf) [bike trails](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/gateway/index.html) in the city,  and the [highest point in St. Paul](https://www.twincities.com/2019/05/27/st-paul-port-authority-inches-closer-toward-buying-shuttered-hillcrest-golf-site-but-were-not-there-yet/), hopefully some day more exciting than a golf course. 

## Where is Ward 6?

[Ward 6](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=52051e36d5054be09480a256803c07c8) is St. Paul's northeast corner, everything east of Edgerton and north of Minnehaha/Bush/Stillwater. Neighborhood-wise, Ward 6 has most of Payne-Phalen and the Greater East Side and a little bit of Dayton's Bluff. 

## The Candidates

[**Alexander Bourne**](http://alexjbourne.com/index/) - a political consultant and entrepreneur

[**Kasim Busuri**](https://neighborsforbusuri.org/) - the incumbent\* councilmember \*WITH \*MANY \*LARGE \*ASTERISKS

[**Greg Copeland**](https://gregcopeland911.wordpress.com/tag/greg-copeland/) - a Republican perennial candidate

[**Danielle Swift**](http://www.swiftfor6.com/) -  a mother, community organizer, and an Eastsider

[**Terri Thao**](https://www.territhao.org/) - program director for [Nexus Community Partners](https://www.nexuscp.org/)

[**Nelsie Yang**](https://www.nelsieyang.com/) - an organizer with [TakeAction Minnesota](https://www.takeactionminnesota.org/)


## Kasim Busuri

Kasim Busuri is the current councilmember for Ward 6, having been appointed as an [interim councilmember](https://www.twincities.com/2019/01/17/kassim-busuri-st-paul-city-council-dan-bostrom-ward-6-seat/) after Dan Bostrom retired. It's standard procedure to appoint an interim councilmember after a retirement from the council; people apply for it like any other job. One of the big, bold requirements for applying is pledging *not* to run for the seat in the next election if you are appointed. This rule is taken seriously by (most of) the council because they don't want to be seen as subverting the democratic process to appoint a successor. Can you guess where this is going? Kasim Busuri pledged not to run, he got the interim job, and he decided to [run for the office anyway](https://www.twincities.com/2019/05/16/kassim-busuri-interim-st-paul-city-council-member-to-run-for-ward-6-seat-after-pledging-not-to/). 

Starting a campaign by breaking the first promise you made to the city you're hoping to represent is, shall we say, not a good look. We want our leaders to be trustworthy and to take their commitments seriously, not to make and break bullshit promises out of pure self-interest. I think such an obvious violation of trust should probably be disqualifying on it's own. 

But if you're less bothered than me about Busuri deciding to run in the first place, don't worry, there are plenty of other good reasons not to vote for him. He has a history of [homophobic statements](https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/20/st-paul-council-member-kassim-busuri-accused-of-anti-gay-remarks/) on social media, including support for an utterly repulsive [anti-gay law](https://www.amnestyusa.org/anti-homosexuality-bill-could-mean-a-death-sentence-for-lgbt-people-in-uganda/) in Uganda. As far as I'm aware, he's never recanted or even apologized for these statements.

Busuri is also a "founding member" of [Saint Paul Strong](https://www.saintpaulstrong.com/), a local advocacy group that prides itself as the anti-trash collection, anti-development, anti-bike lane, anti-transit thorn in the city council's side. I disagree with these folks on most local policy issues, but even setting that aside, I find it baffling that they'll make an alliance with an unashamed homophobe to try and keep a few parking spots and a bit of single-family zoning. Candidates like [Patty Hartmann](https://www.facebook.com/pattyhartmannward3/photos/br.AbrLkWv5m8am-qgKtQDT-l27WP3kqqktvPNoaC51DsITTlM4KbD_dw5SZhrqyiXNwq2daS__tVvoqF9oTolFy1wqP-61trhd_6L-BByMHqUqTtRCneUJDwmioRIZYgrmOxM/931623897192531/?type=1) (Ward 3), [Tarrence Robertson-Bayless](https://www.facebook.com/pattyhartmannward3/photos/br.AbrLkWv5m8am-qgKtQDT-l27WP3kqqktvPNoaC51DsITTlM4KbD_dw5SZhrqyiXNwq2daS__tVvoqF9oTolFy1wqP-61trhd_6L-BByMHqUqTtRCneUJDwmioRIZYgrmOxM/931623897192531/?type=1) (Ward 4), [Shirley Erstad](http://www.startribune.com/as-st-paul-city-council-s-odd-man-out-kassim-busuri-faces-an-uncertain-future/561078362/) (former Ward 4 candidate and Busuri's campagin manager), and current Councilmember [Jane Prince](https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/23/prince-busuri-theres-a-better-way-through-this-st-paul-trash-mess/) should be pressed harder on their association with Busuri and what they think of his disrespect toward the LGBTQ community in St. Paul and around the world. 

## Greg Copeland

Since serving as the Maplewood City Manager, Greg Copeland has run for office [six times](https://ballotpedia.org/Greg_Copeland) (2019 is his seventh), each time filling the role of "lone Republican on the ballot" in a town where that won't get you very far. The tagline on his [website](https://gregcopeland911.wordpress.com/) is "All Minds Matter", which is a very efficient way of communicating to his audience that he is a massive doofus. He's written one blog post this election cycle, an unfocused and poorly-edited rant about the current council, mayor, and schoolboard. 

Don't vote for Greg Copeland.
