*This is part of a series on the [2019 St. Paul Elections](https://firewally.net/post/st-paul-election-guide-2019)*

Alright, we are finally to the real City Council action in Ward 6, home of some [excellent pancakes](http://www.cookstp.com/), the intersection of two of the [nicest](https://www.ramseycounty.us/sites/default/files/Parks%20and%20Recreation/Regional%20Trail%20Maps%20-%20Bruce%20Vento.pdf) [bike trails](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/gateway/index.html) in the city,  and the [highest point in St. Paul](https://www.twincities.com/2019/05/27/st-paul-port-authority-inches-closer-toward-buying-shuttered-hillcrest-golf-site-but-were-not-there-yet/), hopefully some day more exciting than a golf course. 

## Where is Ward 6?

[Ward 6](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=52051e36d5054be09480a256803c07c8) is St. Paul's northeast corner, everything east of Edgerton and north of Minnehaha/Bush/Stillwater. Neighborhood-wise, Ward 6 has most of Payne-Phalen and the Greater East Side and a little bit of Dayton's Bluff. 

## The Candidates

[**Alexander Bourne**](http://alexjbourne.com/index/) - a political consultant and entrepreneur

[**Kasim Busuri**](https://neighborsforbusuri.org/) - the incumbent\* councilmember \*WITH \*MANY \*LARGE \*ASTERISKS

[**Greg Copeland**](https://gregcopeland911.wordpress.com/tag/greg-copeland/) - a Republican perennial candidate

[**Danielle Swift**](http://www.swiftfor6.com/) -  a mother, community organizer, and an Eastsider

[**Terri Thao**](https://www.territhao.org/) - program director for [Nexus Community Partners](https://www.nexuscp.org/)

[**Nelsie Yang**](https://www.nelsieyang.com/) - an organizer with [TakeAction Minnesota](https://www.takeactionminnesota.org/)

## Alexander Bourne

This is the last ward I'm writing about and I'm very tired of finding new ways to creatively dismiss [anti-trash](https://firewally.net/post/the-trash-post/) candidates. Also, Alexander Bourne has been [accused of acts of violence](https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/06/a-look-at-the-criminal-histories-of-candidates-for-st-paul-city-council/) enough times by enough people, particularly former romantic partners, that I don't think you should seriously consider him for a leadership position in our city. 

## Kasim Busuri

Kasim Busuri is the current councilmember for Ward 6, having been appointed as an [interim councilmember](https://www.twincities.com/2019/01/17/kassim-busuri-st-paul-city-council-dan-bostrom-ward-6-seat/) after Dan Bostrom retired. It's standard procedure to appoint an interim councilmember after a retirement from the council; people apply for it like any other job. One of the big, bold requirements for applying is pledging *not* to run for the seat in the next election if you are appointed. This rule is taken seriously by (most of) the council because they don't want to be seen as subverting the democratic process to appoint a successor. Can you guess where this is going? Kasim Busuri pledged not to run, he got the interim job, and he decided to [run for the office anyway](https://www.twincities.com/2019/05/16/kassim-busuri-interim-st-paul-city-council-member-to-run-for-ward-6-seat-after-pledging-not-to/). 

Starting a campaign by breaking the first promise you made to the city you're hoping to represent is, shall we say, not a good look. We want our leaders to be trustworthy and to take their commitments seriously, not to make and break bullshit promises out of pure self-interest. I think such an obvious violation of trust should probably be disqualifying on it's own. 

But if you're less bothered than me about Busuri deciding to run in the first place, don't worry, there are plenty of other good reasons not to vote for him. He has a history of [homophobic statements](https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/20/st-paul-council-member-kassim-busuri-accused-of-anti-gay-remarks/) on social media, including support for an utterly repulsive [anti-gay law](https://www.amnestyusa.org/anti-homosexuality-bill-could-mean-a-death-sentence-for-lgbt-people-in-uganda/) in Uganda. As far as I'm aware, he's never recanted or even apologized for these statements.

Busuri is also a "founding member" of [Saint Paul Strong](https://www.saintpaulstrong.com/), a local advocacy group that prides itself as the anti-trash collection, anti-development, anti-bike lane, anti-transit thorn in the city council's side. I disagree with these folks on most local policy issues, but even setting that aside, I find it baffling that they'll make an alliance with an unashamed homophobe to try and keep a few parking spots and a bit of single-family zoning. Candidates like [Patty Hartmann](https://www.facebook.com/pattyhartmannward3/photos/br.AbrLkWv5m8am-qgKtQDT-l27WP3kqqktvPNoaC51DsITTlM4KbD_dw5SZhrqyiXNwq2daS__tVvoqF9oTolFy1wqP-61trhd_6L-BByMHqUqTtRCneUJDwmioRIZYgrmOxM/931623897192531/?type=1) (Ward 3), [Tarrence Robertson-Bayless](https://www.facebook.com/pattyhartmannward3/photos/br.AbrLkWv5m8am-qgKtQDT-l27WP3kqqktvPNoaC51DsITTlM4KbD_dw5SZhrqyiXNwq2daS__tVvoqF9oTolFy1wqP-61trhd_6L-BByMHqUqTtRCneUJDwmioRIZYgrmOxM/931623897192531/?type=1) (Ward 4), [Shirley Erstad](http://www.startribune.com/as-st-paul-city-council-s-odd-man-out-kassim-busuri-faces-an-uncertain-future/561078362/) (former Ward 4 candidate and Busuri's campagin manager), and current Councilmember [Jane Prince](https://www.twincities.com/2019/10/23/prince-busuri-theres-a-better-way-through-this-st-paul-trash-mess/) should be pressed harder on their association with Busuri and what they think of his disrespect toward the LGBTQ community in St. Paul and around the world. 

## Greg Copeland

Since serving as the Maplewood City Manager, Greg Copeland has run for office [six times](https://ballotpedia.org/Greg_Copeland) (2019 is his seventh), each time filling the role of "lone Republican on the ballot" in a town where that won't get you very far. The tagline on his [website](https://gregcopeland911.wordpress.com/) is "All Minds Matter", which is a very efficient way of communicating to his audience that he is a massive doofus. He's written one blog post this election cycle, an unfocused and poorly-edited rant about the current council, mayor, and schoolboard. 

Don't vote for Greg Copeland. 

## Danielle Swift

Danielle Swift looks like she's headed in the right direction, but there are other candidates who are further ahead of her. Her [campaign website](http://www.swiftfor6.com/more-on-housing/) mentions that she's worked in housing advocacy, but it doesn't really give specifics about what organization or what she's been able to accomplish. I do like that she specifically mentions a "housing crisis" in the Twin Cities, I think that's an appropriate frame for the problem, but her campaign site is pretty light on details or discussion of other issues she'd like to tackle if she were elected. 

Similarly, Swift gave a really [solid answer](https://youtu.be/RJ7AgtvVx3U?t=2965) (link should start at 49:25) to a question about density at the SPNN candidate forum. She's in favor of more duplexes and four-plexes and is totally right when she says "the way that our city is growing, we don't really have an option whether to choose to increase density or not". Also, she apparently sits on the Board of Zoning Appeals? Why doesn't she mention that relevant experience on her campaign site?

Compared to the more detailed policy positions, higher participation in questionnaires and forums, and many endorsements of Yang and Thao, it'd be hard to argue that Danielle Swift should get the #1 position on your ballot, but she seems like she cares about the right issues and you should definitely rank her over Busuri. 

For fairness' sake, I should probably mention that Alexander Bourne [accused](https://www.twincities.com/2019/02/11/st-paul-city-council-candidate-accuses-another-candidate-of-assault-police-find-no-crime-was-committed/) Swift of assaulting him after the police were called to a dispute involving both candidates. You can read the details at the link - I don't think either candidate comes off particularly great here but Bourne managed to put a bigger foot in his mouth by threatening the officer with budget cuts if he gets elected to the council. Yikes. 

## Terri Thao

Before I get into the details, I want to say that this election makes me very glad that we have [ranked choice voting](https://www.ramseycounty.us/residents/elections-voting/voters/ranked-voting) in St. Paul, because we have two very well qualified candidates for the City Council in Ward 6. Nelsie Yang and Terri Thao have a number of similarities between them as candidates (both are Hmong women, both work for local nonprofits doing relevant work, both count a number of significant endorsements from local DFL politicians and groups), so I'm going to try and help parse the differences between them, but I want to make it clear that Ward 6 voters should be glad of the opportunity to vote for both of these two candidates and not worry about handing the race over to a wild card. 

## Nelsie Yang
