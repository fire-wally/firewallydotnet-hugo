Alright, we are finally finally to the real City Council action in Ward 6, home of some [excellent pancakes](http://www.cookstp.com/), the intersection of two of the [nicest](https://www.ramseycounty.us/sites/default/files/Parks%20and%20Recreation/Regional%20Trail%20Maps%20-%20Bruce%20Vento.pdf) [bike trails](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/gateway/index.html) in the city,  and the [highest point in St. Paul](https://www.twincities.com/2019/05/27/st-paul-port-authority-inches-closer-toward-buying-shuttered-hillcrest-golf-site-but-were-not-there-yet/), hopefully some day more exciting than a golf course. 

## Where is Ward 6?

[Ward 6](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=52051e36d5054be09480a256803c07c8) is St. Paul's northeast corner, everything east of Edgerton and north of Minnehaha/Bush/Stillwater. Neighborhood-wise, Ward 6 has most of Payne-Phalen and the Greater East Side and a little bit of Dayton's Bluff.
