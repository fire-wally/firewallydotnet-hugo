## Contact Me

The best way to contact me is at my personal email: <code>{wally} at \[firewally\] dot (net)</code>

My favorite social media account is [@firewally@mspsocial.net](https://mspsocial.net/@firewally). You can follow me from any [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instance or any other place in the ["fediverse"](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse/). If you'd like an invite to a twin-cities-focused social network hosted at https://mspsocial.net/, send me an email and I'll get you set up. 

I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fire_wally), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/fire_wally), [Github](https://github.com/fire-wally/), and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-ricard-3a9b3024).
